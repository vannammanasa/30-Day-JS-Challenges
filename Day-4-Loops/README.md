<strong>Day-4 - Loops </strong>
<hr>


By the end of these activities
•	Understood the usage of 'for' loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
•	Utilized while loops for iteration based on a condition.
•	Applied do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
•	Implemented nested loops to solve more complex problems.
•	Used loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
