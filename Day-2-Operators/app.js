//Activity-1:-(Arithmetic Operators):-
//1.Program to add 2 numbers & log the result to the console.
let num1 = 7;
let num2 = 15;
console.log(num1 + num2);


//2.Program to subtract 2 numbers & log the result to the console.
let num1_sub = 17;
let num2_sub = 15;
console.log(num1_sub - num2_sub);
//3.Program to multiply 2 numbers & log the result to the console.
let num1_mul = 70;
let num2_mul = 15;
console.log(num1_mul * num2_mul);
//4.Program to divide 2 numbers & log the result to the console.
let num1_div = 7;
let num2_div = 15;
console.log(num1_div /  num2_div);


//5.Program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another log the result to the console.

let num1_rem = 7;
let num2_rem = 15;
console.log(num1_rem % num2_rem);



//Activity-2 - (Assignment Operators):-
//6.Use the += operator to add a number to a variable & log the result to the console

let a = 7;
a += 10
console.log(a)

//7.Use the -= operator to subtract a number to a variable & log the result to the console.
let b = 37;
b -= 10
console.log(b)

//Activity-3 - (Comparison Operators):-

//8.Program to compare 2 numbers using > and < & log the result to the console.
let d = 9;
let e = 90;
console.log(d>e)
//9.Program to compare 2 numbers using >= and <= & log the result to the console.
let f = 9;
let g = 90;
console.log(f >=g)

//10.Program to compare 2 numbers using == and === & log the result to the console.
let h = 190;
let i = 500;
console.log(h==i); //false

let j = '40';
let k = 40;
console.log(j === k) //false


//Activity-4 - (Logical Operators):-

//11.Program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions & log the result to the console.
let m = 80;
let n = 80;
console.log(m == n && m === n) //true

//12.Program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions & log the result to the console..
let o = 80;
let p = 89;
console.log(o <= p || o === p) //true

//13.Program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition & log the result to the console.
console.log(!true) //false


//Activity-5-(Ternary Operator):-

//4. Program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is +ve or -ve
console.log(-7 >= 0 ? 'postive':'negative') //negative


//Feature Request:-
//1.Arithmetic Operations Script - Create a Script that performs basic arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/)

//2.Comparison & Logical Operators Script - Create a script that compares 2 numbers using diff.comparison operators  & combines conditions using logical operators,logging the result
//3.Ternary Operator Script - Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is +ve or -ve & logging the result.
